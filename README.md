# Using-IBM-PowerAI-Vision-to-count-cars-with-Object-Detection
IBM PowerAI Vision is a software tool that leverages AI and deep learning models to perform visual recognition tasks such as object detection. It provides a simple way to train and deploy deep learning models for visual tasks like counting cars in an image or video. IBM PowerAI Vision is typically used in an enterprise environment and has an intuitive interface for training models on custom datasets.

While there isn't a direct Python API provided by PowerAI Vision itself for every task, it integrates well with other frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV, allowing for custom applications like counting cars in an image or video stream.
High-Level Steps for Counting Cars with Object Detection:

    Set up IBM PowerAI Vision: You'll need to have an instance of PowerAI Vision set up with access to the IBM PowerAI Vision platform.
    Prepare a Dataset: You'll need a labeled dataset of images with cars. The images should have bounding boxes around the cars (i.e., the cars should be labeled with "car" in an object detection format like COCO or Pascal VOC).
    Train an Object Detection Model: Use IBM PowerAI Vision's GUI to train a model on your car detection dataset. Alternatively, you can use pretrained models like Faster R-CNN or YOLO.
    Deploy the Model and Count Cars: After training and deploying the model, you can use it to detect cars in new images or video streams.

Since PowerAI Vision handles much of the heavy lifting of training and model deployment, once your model is deployed, you can use it for inference using the model's API.
Steps for Implementing Car Counting with Object Detection

Below is a generic Python code example for how you might count cars using object detection. While IBM PowerAI Vision uses its own model and interface, here is how you would generally approach the task using a framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch, with a pre-trained object detection model.
1. Install Dependencies

You need the TensorFlow and OpenCV libraries:

pip install tensorflow opencv-python

2. Load a Pre-trained Object Detection Model (e.g., SSD or Faster R-CNN)

Here’s an example using TensorFlow and a pre-trained SSD (Single Shot Detector) model from TensorFlow Hub. This model can detect objects like cars, people, etc.

import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load pre-trained object detection model (e.g., SSD with MobileNet)
model = tf.saved_model.load('ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco/saved_model')

# Load label map for COCO dataset (the COCO dataset has labels like 'car', 'person', etc.)
category_index = {
    1: {'id': 1, 'name': 'person'},
    3: {'id': 3, 'name': 'car'},
    4: {'id': 4, 'name': 'motorcycle'},
    # Add more categories if needed
}

# Load image (replace with your image path)
image_path = 'your_image.jpg'
image_np = cv2.imread(image_path)
image_np_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(image_np, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

# Convert the image into the right format (TensorFlow expects a tensor)
input_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(image_np_rgb)
input_tensor = input_tensor[tf.newaxis,...]

# Run the model
model_fn = model.signatures['serving_default']
output_dict = model_fn(input_tensor)

# Extract the detection results
boxes = output_dict['detection_boxes'].numpy()
scores = output_dict['detection_scores'].numpy()
classes = output_dict['detection_classes'].numpy().astype(np.int32)
num_detections = int(output_dict['num_detections'].numpy())

# Threshold for detection (for example, only consider detections with a confidence above 0.5)
threshold = 0.5
detected_cars = 0

# Iterate through the detections and count the cars
for i in range(num_detections):
    if scores[0][i] > threshold and classes[0][i] == 3:  # '3' is the class ID for 'car' in COCO
        detected_cars += 1
        box = boxes[0][i]
        cv2.rectangle(image_np, (int(box[1] * image_np.shape[1]), int(box[0] * image_np.shape[0])),
                      (int(box[3] * image_np.shape[1]), int(box[2] * image_np.shape[0])), (0, 255, 0), 2)

# Display the result
cv2.putText(image_np, f'Cars Detected: {detected_cars}', (10, 30), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (255, 0, 0), 2)
image_np_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(image_np, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
plt.imshow(image_np_rgb)
plt.show()

print(f"Total number of cars detected: {detected_cars}")

Explanation:

    Model Loading: We use a pre-trained SSD MobileNet V2 model from TensorFlow's saved model. This model is trained to detect objects in the COCO dataset, which includes 'car' as one of the labels.
    Object Detection: The image is processed through the model, which detects bounding boxes around objects in the image.
    Car Counting: We check if the detected object is a car (using class ID 3 for 'car' from the COCO dataset). If the detection score is above a given threshold (e.g., 0.5), we count the car.
    Bounding Boxes: We draw bounding boxes around the detected cars and display the count.
    Displaying Results: The result is displayed using OpenCV and Matplotlib.

Steps for Using IBM PowerAI Vision:

If you're specifically looking to use IBM PowerAI Vision, here’s an overview of the steps you'd follow using IBM's platform (since it involves using their web interface and model training):

    Create a New Project in IBM PowerAI Vision:
        Go to the IBM PowerAI Vision dashboard and create a new project for object detection.
        Upload a labeled dataset with images of cars and other objects, and ensure the dataset has labels for "car" or other relevant categories.

    Train the Object Detection Model:
        Use IBM PowerAI Vision’s GUI to train an object detection model with your labeled dataset.
        The platform will automatically preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

    Deploy the Model:
        After training, deploy the model on PowerAI Vision.
        You’ll be given an API endpoint that you can use to run inference on new images.

    Count Cars Using the API:
        Once the model is deployed, you can use the PowerAI Vision API to send an image for inference.
        Based on the predictions from the model, count the number of cars in the image or video stream.

Example of Using IBM PowerAI Vision API:

import requests
import json

# Replace with your IBM PowerAI Vision API endpoint and API key
url = "https://your-ibm-powerai-vision-api-endpoint/v1/object-detection"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}

# Example image data (replace with actual image file path or URL)
image_path = "your_image.jpg"

with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
    image_data = image_file.read()

# Make an API request to get predictions
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, files={"image": image_data})

# Parse and print the results
if response.status_code == 200:
    response_data = response.json()
    detected_objects = response_data.get("predictions", [])
    
    car_count = sum(1 for obj in detected_objects if obj["label"] == "car")
    print(f"Number of cars detected: {car_count}")
else:
    print("Error in making API request:", response.text)

In this example:

    You would send the image to IBM PowerAI Vision's object detection API.
    The API returns the list of detected objects, and you can filter and count the occurrences of "car".

Conclusion:

    If you are using IBM PowerAI Vision, use its GUI for training and model deployment. You can then make API calls to count cars in new images.
    If you’re working with custom code, using TensorFlow or PyTorch with pre-trained models like SSD or Faster R-CNN, you can implement car counting through object detection.
